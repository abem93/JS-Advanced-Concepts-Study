Design Patterns
- design patterns are basically a best practice so your code, or everyone on the team codes in the same way, or that your code can be easily read and fix when problems arise.

Builder Pattern 
- Allows us to create objects without having to define properties, and without given value to those properties.

Fascade Pattern
- Basically create a function that contains all the similar information and takes in a parameter the only in formation that changes such as a url.

Observer pattern
- an object that updates something and then notifies observers when changes happen. 
- unsure how functions happen in there.
  - after class made more sense.

Destructuring
- Allows you to access and you use properties and variables in objects and arrays in a more efficient and cleaner way
 seem pretty straight forward just need pracice using it.
